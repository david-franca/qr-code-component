### What I learned

How to change a favicon in a Next.JS project using a .png image with 32x32.

Create a public folder in the root of project and a img folder. Put inside your file and rename it to "favicon" for a better semantic.

Then add this block of code and insert in the layout.tsx inside of html tag.

```html
<html>
  <link rel="icon" href="/img/favicon.png" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" />
  ...
</html>
```

### Continued development

I need to continue focusing in improve performance in a application and semantic html tag. Other thing is to learn about testing and validations.
